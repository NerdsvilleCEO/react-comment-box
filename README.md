Comment Box
=====
This is a package I created based off of the React tutorial @ https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

# Usage
    npm install comment-box
    <open file>
    
    var CommentBox = require('comment-box').CommentBox;
   Then you can use the component as you would any other React component :)
